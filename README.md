 It began with me noticing someone had blocked me. I messages their friend a crown and asked if they were talking to someone, which they said they were. I proceeded to see from my friend the person who blocked me slandered my ship in public. I asked the friend "can i please not be publicly insulted?" then me and my other friend got blocked and called ugly. not great of them, is it? the ex - friend decided to tell people i "forced" him to do charlastor. Not even the day before my friend left me for those people i told him that i would be okay sitting as his ships (radioapple, radiostatic, etc). this too is an attempt to gain sympathy. multiple times this man, Elliot, has ruined my name. Elliot has in the past called me names, including st^p1d b1tch, and has called me a homophobe for being upset he broke up with me. (im pansexual and aroace).
