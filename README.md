hello. id like to clarify yes, i am talking to elliot. my reasoning is because a recent situation, out of elliots control, affected us both negatively. ive come to the realization that some of the things he had said which i found strange were said during a mental health crisis and some were spurred on by others. We both have became friends after a person twisted my words and made elliot believe i was in the wrong. this has happened before and was the reason why i was negative to elliot. i realize now that i shouldnt of put anything about elliot up, or should have explained the situation more clearly. currently i am at a state of disliking the most recent person who twisted my words to make elliot hate me. no i will not share names. i ask that if you want to talk to me about why or what happened to bring us back to a state of being friends, do it PRIVATELY. i have no time to deal with public drama anymore as i am trying to focus on highschool.
